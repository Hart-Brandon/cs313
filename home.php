    <p>Hey everybody!</p>
    <p> My name is Brandon Hart and I'm very excited to take this course. 
        It seems to be set up very similar to CIT 336. I had a great time
        learning the basics of PHP and databases in that course and I am 
        looking forward to building on that knowledge during this semester.</p>
    <p> This is (hopefully) my last year before I graduate with my degree in
        Web Design and Development. I've been hitting the books hard for the last
        year and a half and I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
        During this time I have been in school I have had the unique opportunity to
        also be Mr. Mom. It has been great, and a little stressful at times, to
        spend so much time with our son. I haven't had a whole lot of time to
        myself with the amount of time school and raising a child requires of me
        so hopefully I can tag out and get a full time job so my wife can come
        home and do her thing.</p>
    <p> A few of the things I have enjoyed doing during my free time is finishing
        The Wheel of Time Series, again, and playing the occasional video game with
        my friends that have moved far away from me. Having a dedicated game night
        has made it really easy to stay caught up with what everyone is doing.</p>
    <p> I want to wish everyone good luck the semester! Have fun!</p>
    <p> Brandon Hart</p>
